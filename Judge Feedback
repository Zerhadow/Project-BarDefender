Judges Feedback

I loved the general vibe and aesthetic. The potion hunting was the least interesting part and took to long, I was way more engaged once I was 
put in the club with the boss fight - I would lean more on that in your game loop or at least get to it faster. There were SO many collision bugs 
and I even got trapped in hole. Combat doesn't feel satisfying at all, but I loved all the custom animations. Once I learned I could Flex that's all 
I wanted to do - I wish it was more central to the gameplay! This game badly needs more impactful hit confirms and audio/visual feedback systems for 
collecting and damaging. Fix the collisions, then make the combat more interesting, then focus on getting throuhg the loop faster to show the interesting 
parts of your game! Loved the aesthetic and style.

Game needs more bread crumbs to direct the player where to go. More than once I fell out of the level and had to quit the game and start over. 
Needs audio cues when attacking. Needs env interaction cues, like am I supposed to be able to climb a tree? Because I did and then fell out of the level. 
More interested with Flexing than anything lol.

Character controller needs some love (jumping, gravity physics, etc.), but I love the artwork. Gameplay/goal could also be more clear in each level 
(even a simple "collect ingredients" tagline would work). Don't make me press "Enter" in a WASD + Mouse control scheme when your already using "Space" to continue, 
and don't have a quit button in a webGL build (it broke and I ended up just downloading it).
