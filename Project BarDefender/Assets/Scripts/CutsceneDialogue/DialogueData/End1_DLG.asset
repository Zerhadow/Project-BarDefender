  - That was a pretty impressive display you put on there, love.
  - Thank you so much for taking care of that.
  - This is why your my favorite.
  - After I close up, would like to have a drink with me?
  - ...Or, if you're still okay with helping me out, I could use some more ingredients
    for the bar.
  - Tomorrow's supposed to be busy one!
  - But, the choice is yours, love. I don't mind either way.
