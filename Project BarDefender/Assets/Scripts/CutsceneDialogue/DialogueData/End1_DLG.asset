  - That was a pretty impressive display you put on there, love.
  - This is why your my favorite~
  - Why don't you sit back and get comfortable, and I'll pour you some nice cold
    drinks.
  - ...Or, if you're interested, I can make you something extra special.
  - I'd just need a couple more ingredients from the forest.
  - But, the choice is yours, love.
