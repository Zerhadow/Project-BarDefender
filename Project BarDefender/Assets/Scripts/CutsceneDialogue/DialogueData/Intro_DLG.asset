  - Hi love~ Welcome back to the Midnight Brew.
  - I'm *so* happy to see you here again.
  - I'd make a little drink for my favorite regular, but looks like we're running
    low on ingredients.
  - I need someone good with their hands, and you seem the *perfect* person for the
    job.
  - Why don't you put those big muscles to work and fetch some materials for me?
  - You'd do that for your favorite bartender, right love?
  - Just go out into the forest and gather ingredients. You can leave the rest to
    me.
  - Just make sure to be back by happy hour! Thanks love~
