  - Hi love. Welcome back to the Midnight Brew.
  - I'm so happy to see you here again tonight!
  - I'd make your favorite drink for you, but...
  - It looks like we're running low on ingredients.
  - Would you be a dear, and gather what you can from the forest?
  - Once you come back, you can leave the rest to me.
  - Just make sure to be back by happy hour! Thanks love~
