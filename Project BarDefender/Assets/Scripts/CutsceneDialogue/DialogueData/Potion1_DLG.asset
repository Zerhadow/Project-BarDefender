  - Welcome back, my love!
  - Glad to see you're back in one piece.
  - Earlier, I heard a commotion in the ballroom, but I've been a little too nervous
    to check it out.
  - It's scaring other customers.... Would you be a doll and take look for me?
  - I'll make a special drink for you, on the house.
